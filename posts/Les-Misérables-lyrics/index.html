missed it twenty long years ago.<br>My life was a war that could never be won<br>They gave me a number and murdered Valjean<br>When they chained Me and left me for dead<br>Just for stealing a mouthful of bread.<br>Yet why did I allow this man<br>To touch my soul and teach me love?<br>He treated me like any other.<br>He gave me his trust.<br>He called me Brother.<br>My life he claims for God above.<br>Can such things be?<br>For I had come to hate the world.<br>This world that always hated me!<br>Take an eye for an eye.<br>Turn your heart into stone.<br>This is all I have lived for.<br>This is all I have known.<br>One word from him and I&rsquo;d be back<br>Beneath the lash, upon the rack.<br>Instead, he offers me my freedom.<br>I feel my shame inside me like a knife.<br>He told me that I have a soul.<br>How does he know?<br>What spirit comes to move my life?<br>Is there another way to go?<br>I am reaching, but I fall,<br>And the night is closing in,<br>And I stare into
